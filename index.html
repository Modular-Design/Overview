                <p>
                    MSYS stands for Modulare (Digital) Systems.
                    Describing a system, where each component of a process has certain interfaces to interact with each other.

                <p>
                    The goal of MSYS is to give a standard to exchange and include process based knowledge and expertise.
                    Enabling users from all over the world to participate, by providing or include expert knowledge in there projects, a new age digitized development and design process could be started.

                <p>
                    MSYS provides a powerful API-System to include digital knowledge from experts all around the globe.
                    While MSYS is completely open source, the system connected with each other are not.
                    Givin scientists the opportunity to make there expertise available and protecting the things the do not want to share.
                    MSYS allows to set a price policy, so each time someone uses models or experimental data the researcher provided  they can profit from this.

                <p>
                    MSYS's focus on digitalization of design and development processes does not mean that manufactures are out of scope.
                    With an increasing development in distributed productions, printer-farmes or automated assembly and testing,
                    MSYS is designed to connect these processes.

                    The main feature of MSYS is to combine models, simulations, databases, designs, etc. to digitalize and automatize the design and development process.
                    With a network based API, MSYS allows his users to work and contribute on projects from around the world.
                    Further, with more and more contributers users can get access to state of the art technology without the budget of a big company.

                <h2>Investors</h2>
                <p>
                    MSYS allows the users to include external knowledge into the design process.
                    This creates a market with knowledge providern and consumers.
                    MSYS also allows to build markets around this dynamic, with the goal to connect the different parties, 
                    to ensure quality and manage the transaction process.
                    <br>
                    There are multiple strategies how these markets could make a profit out of this.
                    But one of the most important factors to success will probably be fact of how early the are available to the users.
